# Restaurant Reviews App Project
***
This is my _fifth_ project in Udacity Front-End Nano Degree.

## About the project
***
- A starter code is given to me, you can download it from [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
- In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. 
- The design must be:
  - **responsive** on different sized displays.
  - **Accessible** for screen reader use. 
  - It will also be added a **service worker** to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.
